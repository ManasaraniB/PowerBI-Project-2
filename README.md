##  Project Overview
A Power BI dashboard analyzing supply chain performance through cost, revenue, and transportation metrics. The report visualizes key KPIs such as total revenue, total cost, shipping cost, and mode-wise profitability to uncover optimization opportunities in logistics and supplier management.
##  Dataset
**File:** `supply_chain_data.csv`
Key columns include:
- `Product_Category` – Product classification (e.g., cosmetics, haircare, skincare)
- `Supplier` – Supplier/partner responsible for goods
- `Transportation_Mode` – Type of shipping (Road, Rail, Air, Sea)
- `Route` – Shipping route used (A, B, or C)
- `Revenue`, `Cost`, `Shipping_Cost` – Financial performance indicators
- `Quantity_Sold` – Total units sold
- `Gender` – Customer demographic breakdown
## 📈 Key Insights
- 🚚 **Transportation Efficiency:** Road and Rail modes are both costlier and more profitable, suggesting high demand through these routes.  
- 📦 **Supplier Impact:** Top two suppliers generate most of the revenue, indicating potential supplier dependency.  
- 🧮 **Route Costs:** Route A drives the largest cost burden—optimizing it could yield savings.
